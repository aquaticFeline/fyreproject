Hello! 
I made this code for my FYRE Project.
I wanted to make a simple game using machine learning / AI for my artistry

neuralproject.py is the game in a text only interface
neuralprojectGUI.py is the game with a GUI

Instructions:
Make sure you have Python IDLE installed.

This program only uses the modules sklearn and tkinter
tkinter is a built in module, but you can download sklearn by doing
	pip install -U scikit-learn
in the terminal
